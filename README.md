<h1 align="center"> Cabricality Utils </h1>

This is a Minecraft mod for [Cabricality](https://github.com/DM-Earth/Cabricality) modpack. Currently, it only supports **Quilt 1.18.2**.

## Contents

- Extractor machines (like thermal's). It can extract resin from trees next to it. Rubber trees can make it faster.
- Fluids for the modpack, for replacing KubeJS fluid registries.

## Functions

- Make Trade Cards and Profession Cards easier to translate.
- Replace Ad Astra and Bits and Chisels' wrench with the Create one.
- Catch the registrations with namespace of `cabricality` and add them to modded DataFixers.
- Move items form KubeJS to a new item group instead of that KubeJS one.
- Use (water) bucket to kill blazes.

When certain necessary mods are not loaded:

- Stop dedicated server at startup.
- Replace client translatable texts and splashes to notify the player.

## Fixes

- Fix Create Fabric's hose pulleys.
